# jtrpc-netty
An experimental typesafe RPC library built using netty and cglib

jtrpc generates proxy objects from either interfaces or classes for remote invocation of matching registered methods on server, enabling extremely simple client-server communication in just a couple lines of code. 

check [tests](src/test/java) for an example. 

Cleaning is required, some critical bugs still exist and some functionality is unfinished / partly implemented.
